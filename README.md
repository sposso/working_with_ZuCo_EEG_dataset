# working_with_ZuCo_EEG_dataset
This tutorial explains the preprocessing steps applied to EEG data in the studies â€œ[ZuCo](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018291): A Simultaneous EEG and Eye-Tracking Resource for Natural Sentence Reading, and "[ZuCo 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00903): A dataset of physiological recordings during natural reading and annotation". 

ZuCo v.1 is a dataset combining EEG and eye-tracking recordings from subjects reading natural sentences. Eye-tracking makes it possible to mark the exact boundaries of each word as a subject reads a sentence, which in turn allows precise extraction of the corresponding EEG signals for every word.
Main features:
1. Subjects: 12 healthy adult native speakers

The reading materials contain sentences from movie reviews from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and biographical sentences about notable people from the Wikipedia relation extraction corpus.
- Sentences from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank: 123 neutral, 137 negative, and 140 positive sentences. Total sentences: 400
- Sentences from the Wikipedia relation extraction dataset for the Normal Reading (NR) task: 300
- Sentences from the Wikipedia relation extraction dataset for the task-specific relation task: 407
4. Procedure: The sentences were presented to the subjects in a naturalistic reading scenario, where the complete sentence was presented on the screen and the subjects read each sentence at their own speed.
